# video
I want the video to remain sequential and as much in the context of the conversation aas possible so I'll set a naming standard
The naming standard for video in this repo will follow the naming standard of the digoo ir security camera beginning with the date as "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[C$]_????" I think the last four is resolution but I'll specify letters for each type of devioce which was hacked
If need be, I'll come up with a better naming standard.
"N" digoo IR security Camera
"O" One Plus 5t Cellphone
"J" Samsung J7
"S" Samsung Galaxy S6Edge
"L" Moto E4
"M" Moto E5
"D" Dell Inspiron Notebook
"P" Acer Laptiop
"A" Acer Neetbook
"I" Local visitor's phone
"T" Galaxy Tab A
"Z" ZTE cellphone
"R" RPi3B+
"H" Hacker's Choice
"7" Dell 7" Tablet
"6" iPhone 6s
"A" iPad 1st Gen
"G" Samsung Galaxy Nexus
"?" Whatever I forgot
