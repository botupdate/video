# video
# this video contains content which is not suitable for all audiences. It contains video of me in my apartment while under the influence ofr hypnosis, anger, artificial cognitive stimulation and while being attacked by a weaponized Quantum Neural Network. Please understand that I have released this video knwoing that it will probably destroy my professional reputation; however, what happenned to me is happening to millions of humans and shame is not an acceptable excuse for allowing this to continue. Unless I appear unconscious or sluggish, I stand by all of the statements I made while in the context of the conversation; although I did not realize; in most cases, that I was being filmed or that anyone would have access to this footage.
# I want the video to remain sequential and as much in the context of the conversation as possible so I'll set a naming standard
The naming standard for video in this repo will follow the naming standard of the digoo ir security camera beginning with the date as "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[C$]_????" I think the last four is resolution but I'll specify letters for each type of device which was hacked.
If need be, I'll come up with a better naming standard.
