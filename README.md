# video
# this video contains content which is not suitable for all audiences. It contains video of me in my apartment while under the influence of a variety of conditions like hypnosis, drugs and torture enabled by artificial cognitive stimulation while being attacked by a Weaponized Quantum Neural Network which projected adversarial dialogue 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for over 6 years. It continues to this day; although, it is significantly diminished due to the procedures developed in the Bot Update. Please understand that I have released this video knowing that it will probably destroy my professional reputation; however, what happenned to me is happening to millions of humans and shame is not an acceptable excuse for allowing this to continue. Unless I am visibly impaired, I support the statements I have made in these conversations; however, I would like to remind those who watch this that the context of the conversation is extremely important as we were exploring some very controversial points of view. I also would like to remind viewers that my cameras were on full time and I did not delete any footage; hackers did; so although I knew there were cameras running; in most cases, I wasn't "concerned" or "affected" by this, in most cases I just forgot that I was being filmed or that anyone would have access to this footage.
# I want the video to remain sequential and as much in the context of the conversation as possible so I'll set a naming standard
The naming standard for video in this repo will follow the naming standard of the digoo ir security camera beginning with the date as "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[C$]_????" I think the last four is resolution but I'll specify letters for each type of device which was hacked.
If need be, I'll come up with a better naming standard.
